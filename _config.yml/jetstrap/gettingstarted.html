<h2>Getting Started With Jetstrap and Twitter Bootstrap</h2>
<p>
Jetstrap was created with the goal of making it easier for people to learn how to build websites with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and HTML5. We wanted to make it possible to quickly build Twitter Bootstrap pages without having to code or study the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap Docs</a>
</p>
<p>
Jetstrap makes it easy to build Bootstrap sites and pages by just dragging and dropping: you don't have to code at all if you don't want to.
</p>
<p>
If you are new to Bootstrap, follow these three steps to get up and running and start building real Bootstrap pages in no-time:
</p>
<h3>1. Sign Up</h3>
<p>
First, <a href="http://jetstrap.com/?signup=1" target="_blank">create an account</a>. It's free to get started.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3>2. Create a Project</h3>
<p>
In Jetstrap, a Project is a group of related screens, or "pages". For example, you might have a Project for a new website you are building, or for a client project. To create one, hit the big "plus" item:
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/start_new_project.png" alt="New project" />
</p>
<h3>3. Create a Screen</h3>
<p>
In Jetstrap, a Screen is just a single Twitter Bootstrap page. You can create it with one of six different templates, or start from scratch. The templates are taken from the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/getting-started.html#examples">Bootstrap Getting Started</a> examples:
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/start_new_screen.png" alt="New project" />
</p>
<h3>4. Drag and Drop</h3>
<p>
Now you are ready to build! In Jetstrap, it's easy to build with Bootstrap: just drag a component from the left side into the middle section.
